# Python script that monitors the battery status and sends notifications when the
# battery's capacity reaches a critical level.
# It reads the battery status and capacity from system files and then prints a pretty-formatted
# status message for the battery.
# It's for use in minimalist windows managers bars (e.g. dwm, qtile).
